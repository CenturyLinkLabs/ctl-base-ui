# CTL Base UI Kit

The foundation UI kit for CTL labs products residing on the web.

## Language & Framework specific?

Currently this puppy is a mountable (Ruby on Rails) engine. 
We can write SASS and HAML. 
We can mount it as an engine on a Rails project and will get a free style guide, however the assets can also be compiled and included in projects built in different languages.
